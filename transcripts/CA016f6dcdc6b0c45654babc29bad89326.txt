[PATIENT] Hi, I just wanted to confirm my appointment for next Tuesday. Also, can you tell me what to expect during the visit?
[AGENT] Got it.
[PATIENT] Great! I’m just wondering if I need to bring anything specific or if there are any forms I should fill out beforehand. By the way, I might need to reschedule to next Thursday instead.
[AGENT] Understood.
[PATIENT] Could you let me know if next Thursday works for you? And do I need to bring my insurance information or anything else?
[AGENT] I can check availability for next Thursday and let you know what to bring.
[PATIENT] That sounds good, thank you! I just want to make sure I'm fully prepared for the visit.
