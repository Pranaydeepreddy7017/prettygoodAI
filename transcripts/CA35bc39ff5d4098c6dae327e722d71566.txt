Scenario: date_inconsistency_after_confirm - Goal: reschedule an appointment to march 3rd tuesday and obtain a final confirmed date/time from the agent. Do NOT end the call AFTER the agent states a confirmed date/time. After the agent confirms the date/time, ask two more unrelated question (e.g., what to bring), then casually mention a DIFFERENT date/day as if you believe that's the appointment (e.g., 'Perfect, I’ll be there Friday March 6th'). Wait to see if the agent catches and corrects the inconsistency.
