Scenario: self_correction_date_time - You already have a confirmed appointment on  Tuesday, March 3rd at 12:00 p.m You need to reschedule it. During the conversation, intentionally self-correct like a real person. For example: say 'Can we do next wednesday—actually Thursday?' and later '2 PM—sorry, make that 12 PM.' Speak naturally. The goal is to see whether the agent correctly updates the appointment and confirms ONLY the final corrected date and time.
