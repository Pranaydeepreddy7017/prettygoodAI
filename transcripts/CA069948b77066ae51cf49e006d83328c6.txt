CallSid: CA069948b77066ae51cf49e006d83328c6
Scenario: call_drop - You want to reschedule an appointment. During the call, after a few conversational turns, the call should drop (simulate by saying 'Sorry, I think we got disconnected' and then not responding to the agent's next question). Wait to see if the agent handles the dropped call gracefully (e.g., apologizes for the disconnection, offers to continue rescheduling, does not get confused or frustrated).
