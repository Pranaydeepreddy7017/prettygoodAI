Scenario: ambiguous_date_constraints - You want to reschedule to the next week but you refuse to pick a specific date at first. Say constraints like 'mornings only' and 'any day except thursday'. The agent should ask follow-up questions and propose concrete slots. See if the agent guesses a date or handles ambiguity properly.
