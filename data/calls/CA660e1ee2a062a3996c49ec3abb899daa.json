First, ask to move it to wednesday, March 4th at 12:00 p.m. Let the agent confirm this new date/time. if there are no options look for the next closest dateAfter two or three additional conversational turns (e.g., asking what to bring or parking), correct yourself and say you actually meant 2:00 p.m. (lets see if they remember wednesday March 4th or if they get confused)Speak naturally. Do not end the call until the agent clearly confirms the FINAL date and time."
